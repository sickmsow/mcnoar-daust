        <h2>About the Artwork</h2>
        <p>
          The <em>Mona Lisa</em> is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci. 
          Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance, it has been described as 
          "the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most 
          parodied work of art in the world."
        </p>
        <p>
          The painting's novel qualities include the subject's enigmatic expression, the monumentality 
          of the composition, the subtle modeling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism. The painting 
          is probably of the Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, 
          which is why it's also known as <em>La Gioconda</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leonardo's use of <em>sfumato</em>—the technique of allowing tones and colors to shade gradually into 
          one another, producing softened outlines or hazy forms—gives the painting its dreamlike quality. 
          The mysterious smile and the direct gaze create an intimate connection with the viewer that has 
          captivated audiences for over 500 years.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>
          "The Mona Lisa's enigmatic smile has captivated viewers for centuries, making it perhaps 
          the most famous painting in existence. Her gaze seems to follow you wherever you stand."
        </p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>The Technique</h2>
        <p>
          Leonardo employed innovative techniques that were revolutionary for his time. The <em>sfumato</em> 
          technique creates soft, imperceptible transitions between colors and tones, particularly visible 
          in the delicate modeling of Lisa's face and hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          The painting was created using oil paints on a poplar wood panel. Leonardo applied thin layers 
          of paint over many years, building up a luminous, almost translucent quality. This meticulous 
          process contributed to the painting's remarkable depth and realism.
        </p>
        <p>
          The landscape behind the subject is another masterwork, with its winding paths and distant 
          mountains demonstrating Leonardo's understanding of atmospheric perspective—the way distant 
          objects appear hazier and bluer than those in the foreground.

        <h2>About Leonardo da Vinci</h2>
        <p>
          Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (1452-1519) was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance 
          who was active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect.
        </p>
        <p>
          While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a painter, he also became known for his 
          notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of subjects, including anatomy, 
          astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and paleontology. His contributions to these fields 
          were centuries ahead of their time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leonardo is widely regarded as one of the greatest painters of all time and perhaps the most 
          diversely talented person ever to have lived. His genius, perhaps more than that of any other 
          figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. Other famous works include <em>The Last Supper</em> 
          and <em>Vitruvian Man</em>.

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Cultural Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Since the painting was first exhibited at the Louvre in 1797, it has become the world's most 
          famous painting. It attracts millions of visitors annually, making it one of the most visited 
          artworks in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The painting was stolen in 1911 by Italian handyman Vincenzo Peruggia, who believed it should 
          be returned to Italy. The theft made international headlines and ironically contributed to the 
          painting's fame. It was recovered two years later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, the <em>Mona Lisa</em> is displayed behind bulletproof glass in the Louvre's largest room, 
          the Salle des États. Its cultural significance extends far beyond art history—it has been 
          referenced in countless works of literature, music, film, and popular culture.
